# Sharemind MPC

[Sharemind MPC] (https://sharemind.cyber.ee/sharemind-mpc/), a commercial secure multi-party computation framework developed by [Cybernetica] (https://cyber.ee/) is meant for developing production ready MPC applications for the enterprise environment. 

Sharemind MPC uses unsigned integers as basis for additive secret sharing and provides secure arithmetic operations for both unsigned and signed integers. It has secure floating-point arithmetic, a database, persistant storage of datasets, consensus based data access rights management on function and dataset level and a specialized tool Rmind for statistical analysis and machine learning.
Sharemind MPC works with three computing parties and ensures the privacy of the inputs as long as at most one of them is passively corrupted.

For application developers Sharemind MPC provides an open source SDK and an emulator for assessing working times of the application.
Sharemind [developer portal] (https://docs.sharemind.cyber.ee/) provides an overview of the platform, implemented functions of the latest production release and documentation of their use.
